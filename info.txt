`
- Give the first <div> element an id of "app"

- In the html file, we have imported the css file in the
  <head> tag, delete the background-color red in the css file

- Give the body background a shade of gray - use what you want
  Note: in order to see changes to the css you 
  will have to hit the refresh button in the preview
  browser window

- Using the first divs id tag in the css stylesheet, 
  change the font size to 20px 

- delete the starting text and create a new h1 tag 
  within the div, give it a name like "My Pet Website",
  feel free to change it to your liking,and change the 
  <title> tag and give it a name of whatever you want, 
  this is the tab name in your browser

- under the h1 tag create a new div, and optionally
  give it an id with and assign a new background color

- in the new div create a paragraph tag, put something 
  like "things my pet love" or "things dogs love"

- create an unordered list, and within the unordered 
  list create at least 3 list items and think of/find
  3 facts about that top (such as "things dogs love")

- repeat the last two steps, this time do something 
  like "things dogs hate"

- At the top of the first div after the h1, create a
  new img tag, go to google and find an image of a dog,
  and copy the link to the picture and give the img tag 
  the src of that link note: make sure you go to the website
  the image is on and copy the link from there, copying it
  from google doesn't work properly

- Give the img tag an alt (if you hover over the picture 
  it will show the alt text)  the alt text should be a 
  short description of the photo

- Stylize your photo! Give the img tag an id or class 
  and use that to stylize the photo at least give it 
  a border-color, border-width, border-style(use solid),
  and border-radius of 50%,

- As long as everything worked you are finished, feel 
  free to experiment with adding additional styling, 
  such as changing text colors, changing the fonts, 
  background colors, whatever you want.
